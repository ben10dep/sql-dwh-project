Data Warehouse and Analytics Project 🚀

Welcome to the Data Warehouse and Analytics Project repository! This project showcases a comprehensive data warehousing and analytics solution, covering everything from data ingestion to actionable insights. Designed as a portfolio project, it follows industry best practices in data engineering and analytics.

🏗️ Data Architecture

This project follows the Medallion Architecture approach, which includes Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers:

Bronze Layer: Stores raw data directly from source systems. Data is ingested from CSV files into a SQL Server database.

Silver Layer: Processes data cleansing, standardization, and normalization to ensure data quality and consistency.

Gold Layer: Contains business-ready, analytical data modeled into a star schema for reporting and analytics.

📖 Project Overview

🔹 Key Components:

Data Architecture: Implementing a modern data warehouse using Medallion Architecture.

ETL Pipelines: Extracting, transforming, and loading (ETL) data into the warehouse.

Data Modeling: Designing fact and dimension tables optimized for analytical queries.

Analytics & Reporting: Generating SQL-based reports and dashboards for business insights.

🚀 Project Requirements

1️⃣ Data Engineering (Building the Data Warehouse)

Objective:

Develop a modern data warehouse using SQL Server to consolidate sales data, enabling analytical reporting and informed decision-making.

Specifications:

Data Sources: Import data from two source systems (ERP & CRM) as CSV files.

Data Quality: Apply cleansing and transformations before analysis.

Integration: Merge both data sources into a single, structured model.

Scope: Focuses on the latest dataset (historization not required).

Documentation: Provides clear descriptions of the data model to support analytics teams and stakeholders.

2️⃣ Business Intelligence (Analytics & Reporting)

Objective:

Develop SQL-based analytics and reports to gain insights into:

Customer Behavior

Product Performance

Sales Trends

These insights help stakeholders make data-driven decisions.
